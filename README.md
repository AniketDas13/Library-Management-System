# Library Management System
My Computer Science Final Project in Class XII on 'Library Management System' using C++
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 'Library Management System' is a collection of different entities - books, librarian, accountant, customer, student or reader, etc. It is a centralized place where the informations related to different types of books can be found.

The project undertaken does the automation of the 'Library Management System' in an organization. It's having a Menu Driven User Interface and consists of three menus: Main Menu, Books' Menu and Issue Menu. It contains the vital data and informations reguarding book, issue and customer details. Administrator of the project can enter new book and issue details, display all/specific book and issue details and modify book and issue details.

The main reason of developing this software is to reduce the workload and to provide the ease of use to accomplish the desired task along with better service to the customers and society.

Points to be added :
1) Use of "gotoxy" function should be prohibited since it can only be compiled on Turbo C++ which is a very primitive IDE. 
2) Mention the creation of the "BOOK.txt" file else people compiling your code will find trouble in getting the output.
