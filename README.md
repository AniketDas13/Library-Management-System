# Library Management System
My Computer Science Final Project in Class XII on 'Library Management System' using C++
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 'Library Management System' is a collection of different entities - books, librarian, accountant, customer, student or reader, etc. It is a centralized place where the information related to different types of books can be found.

The project undertaken does the automation of the 'Library Management System' in an organization. It's having a Menu-Driven User Interface and consists of three menus: Main Menu, Books' Menu and Issue Menu. It contains the vital data and information regarding book, issue and customer details. The administrator of the project can enter new book and issue details, display all/specific book and issue details and modify book and issue details.

The main reason for developing this software is to reduce the workload and to provide the ease of use to accomplish the desired task along with better service to the customers and society.

N.B.: The provided source code has been executed using 'Turbo C++' IDE, which is quite primitive according to today's standards. I had done this project in Class 12, and 'Turbo C++' was my IDE of choice back then.
I will be updating the source code as per the latest C++ standards soon.
